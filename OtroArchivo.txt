Java Style Guide

The intention of this guide is to provide a set of conventions that encourage good code. It is the distillation of many combined man-years of software engineering and Java development experience. While some suggestions are more strict than others, you should always practice good judgement.

If following the guide causes unnecessary hoop-jumping or otherwise less-readable code, readability trumps the guide. However, if the more 'readable' variant comes with perils or pitfalls, readability may be sacrificed.

In general, much of our style and conventions mirror the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language and Google's Java Style Guide.
